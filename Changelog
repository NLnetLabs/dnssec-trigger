	- Renamed 'open resolvers' to 'relay resolvers' in the explanatory
	  text what dnssec-trigger is doing.  Resolvers from DHCP can also
	  be public resolvers, so the term relay resolver is used for an
	  open resolver that performs transport layer adjustment.

13 January 2015: Wouter
	- Update OSX resolvehook to flush dns caches for new OSX release
	  with "discoveryutil udnsflushcaches" and "discoveryutil
	  mdnsflushcache".
	- Patches from Pavel Simerda:
		dnssec-trigger-script: The accepted version of NetworkManager
			patch uses `resolv.conf` instead of
			`resolv.conf.default`,
			https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=732941
		dnssec-trigger-script: Leaking file descriptors is bad,
			especially when selinux or similar tool is used.
			https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1147705
		dnssec-trigger-script: Use a regular file unless
			use_resolv_secure_conf_symlink is set. Always
			install /var/run/dnssec-trigger/resolv.conf for
			comparison.  Guard all of those regular files using
			immutable attribute.  
			https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1165126
		dnssec-trigger-script: fix desktop file paths.
			

21 November 2014: Wouter
	- Patches from Pavel Simerda:
		dnssec-trigger-script: lock --update-* methods only
			The original locking was a bit too broad for future
			development.
		dnssec-trigger-script: improve /etc/dnssec.conf handling
			Minor changes that make future /etc/dnssec.conf
			extensions easier.
		dnssec-trigger-script: support 'debug' option in
		  /etc/dnssec.conf
			With that you can get the debugging output even
			for instances run by systemd, dnssec-triggerd
			and NetworkManager dispatcher.
		dnssec-trigger-script: clean up resolv.conf backup and
		  restore
			Clean up the code a bit so that later additions
			dont turn it into a mess.
		dnssec-trigger-script: use
		  /var/run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf.default
			Avoid restarting NetworkManager just to restore
			/etc/resolv.conf when a simple symlink would
			do. This is only done when the NetworkManager's
			private resolv.conf actually exists.
		allow the resolv.conf hooks be handled by
		  dnssec-trigger-script
		dnssec-trigger-script: handle resolv.conf events from the
		  daemon
			The new implementation doesn't write directly to
			/etc/resolv.conf and instead it writes a temporary
			file and then replaces the /etc/resolv.conf
			using POSIX `rename()`.
		dnssec-trigger-script: support /etc/resolv.conf and
		  /etc/resolv-secure.conf symlinks
			This is an experimental feature and is
			turned off by default. You need to put the
			following to /etc/dnssec.conf to activate it:
			use_resolv_conf_symlink=yes
		probe: use wildcard probing domains
			This change might need to be revisited to see
			whether we need to check both known wildcard
			and known non-wildcard domains.

8 April 2014: Wouter

	  back initially.  If we ignore them we catch a (100 msec later)
	  correct answer later.  (or timeout if no answer comes).

	  and that config, it keeps the running probe results and open
	  sockets to panels and certificates.

	  the pango-basic-win32.dll and gdk png loader dll (if present)

	- fix not enough detection of network changes on OSX.
	- get a probe after start on OSX.
	- fix submit of disconnect state, submit "".
	- fix resolvconf writes on OSX: more chance of winning resolv.conf
	  which is a small race what with setting scutil at the same time,
	  and sets it after userlogin because OSX reprobes at user login.

8 Sep 2011: Wouter
	- Fix that windows DHCP hook fires less often: only if list of network
	  and GUID of adapter and IPs changes.

	- fix bug with active number of connections.
