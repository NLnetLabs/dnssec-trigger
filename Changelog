14 May 2018: Wouter
	- Patch set from Martin Sehnoutka,
	  It migrates the functionality currently provided by the script
	  into the daemon. the "update" command from the script is available
	  in the daemon as "update_all", so that they can live side by side.
	- Modify the build system:
A new configure option 'with-forward-zones-support' was introduced, that
enables configuration of forward and local zones directly from the
daemon as opposed to the script. Without this option, there is almost no
change.

The new functionality of the daemon can be triggered by the "update_all"
command, which is now used in NM dispatcher script and systemd service
file. Some configuration options were migrated from the script to the
daemon as well.

Finally a testing suite was introduced using the cmocka library.
	- Introduce string_buffer and string_list types:
	String buffer is a fat pointer and list is a single linked list of fat
char pointers.
	- Import JSON parsing library (BSD-MIT license).
	- Connection list module:
A connection is a struct encapsulating the concept of "connection" as
known from NetworkManager. It is used to extract information about
global resolvers, DNS search zones and in the future about reverse zones
corresponding to the network address.
	- Function to parse JSON into connection list
	- Lock module, used to serialize execution in the script
This was introduced as a compatibility feature with the script, but once
the script is gone, this can be safely removed.
	- Store module - persistent storage used by the script
The script uses few files stored on disk in order to create a persistent
cache of configured global forwarders and forward zones. This was
introduced as a compatibility module with the script. Again it can be
removed once the compatibility is not needed any more.
	- Testing suite for previously introduced modules
It can be executed using 'make test' and it can be also used in CI.
	- New configuration options, that were in the script
	- Hook unbound control
It uses 'unbound-control' binary instead of the socket, so this should
probably be rewritten if possible.
	- Reimplement update command from script in riggerd
	- add testing file for global forwarders cache

	- Fixes and modifications from Wouter:
	  - removed -vvv option from dnssec-triggerd daemon start script.
	  - removed unaligned memcpy

	  text what dnssec-trigger is doing.  Resolvers from DHCP can also

	  mdnsflushcache".
	- Patches from Pavel Simerda:
		dnssec-trigger-script: The accepted version of NetworkManager
			patch uses `resolv.conf` instead of
			`resolv.conf.default`,
			https://bugzilla.gnome.org/show_bug.cgi?id=732941
		dnssec-trigger-script: Leaking file descriptors is bad,
			especially when selinux or similar tool is used.
			https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1147705
		dnssec-trigger-script: Use a regular file unless
			use_resolv_secure_conf_symlink is set. Always
			install /var/run/dnssec-trigger/resolv.conf for
			comparison.  Guard all of those regular files using
			immutable attribute.  
			https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1165126
		dnssec-trigger-script: fix desktop file paths.
			

21 November 2014: Wouter
	- Patches from Pavel Simerda:
		dnssec-trigger-script: lock --update-* methods only
			The original locking was a bit too broad for future
			development.
		dnssec-trigger-script: improve /etc/dnssec.conf handling
			Minor changes that make future /etc/dnssec.conf
			extensions easier.
		dnssec-trigger-script: support 'debug' option in
		  /etc/dnssec.conf
			With that you can get the debugging output even
			for instances run by systemd, dnssec-triggerd
			and NetworkManager dispatcher.
		dnssec-trigger-script: clean up resolv.conf backup and
		  restore
			Clean up the code a bit so that later additions
			dont turn it into a mess.
		dnssec-trigger-script: use
		  /var/run/NetworkManager/resolv.conf.default
			Avoid restarting NetworkManager just to restore
			/etc/resolv.conf when a simple symlink would
			do. This is only done when the NetworkManager's
			private resolv.conf actually exists.
		allow the resolv.conf hooks be handled by
		  dnssec-trigger-script
		dnssec-trigger-script: handle resolv.conf events from the
		  daemon
			The new implementation doesn't write directly to
			/etc/resolv.conf and instead it writes a temporary
			file and then replaces the /etc/resolv.conf
			using POSIX `rename()`.
		dnssec-trigger-script: support /etc/resolv.conf and
		  /etc/resolv-secure.conf symlinks
			This is an experimental feature and is
			turned off by default. You need to put the
			following to /etc/dnssec.conf to activate it:
			use_resolv_conf_symlink=yes
		probe: use wildcard probing domains
			This change might need to be revisited to see
			whether we need to check both known wildcard
			and known non-wildcard domains.

8 April 2014: Wouter

	  and sets it after userlogin because OSX reprobes at user login.

8 Sep 2011: Wouter
	- Fix that windows DHCP hook fires less often: only if list of network
	  and GUID of adapter and IPs changes.
